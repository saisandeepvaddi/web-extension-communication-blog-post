# web-extension-communication-blog-post

This is sample code for the [blog post on my website](https://saisandeepvaddi.com/blog/how-to-communicate-between-content-script-popup-background-in-web-extensions).

Use the `extension` folder for the built version of the code.

This extension also adds some UI to demonstrate messages being passed to Content Script.

To see, install the extension and go to google.com and check top left.

Open console for content script, popup, and background to see messages appear when you click on the buttons.
